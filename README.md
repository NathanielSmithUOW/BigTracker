# BugTracker

This is our GitHub Repository for the CSCI222 Project

This Repository will hold most if not all of our documents and code relating to the project. This is where we can upload all our use cases and diagrams etc.

Currently the folder structure is non-existent, i will add this later when i get home. 

I will be updating this readMe when certain Tasks have been completed.

Tasks to To:

Login Use Case Implementation
Regisiter Use Case Implemention 



Note: NEVER EVER Upload Broken code to the repository, if it is unfinished code, just comment the unfinished part out so it will still compile correctly, and note it down on the description for when you commit the file.
